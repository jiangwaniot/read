MIT Deep Learning Book in PDF format

This book was downloaded in HTML form and conviniently joined as a single PDF file for your enjoyment. Please notice the known issues in the web page, especially with regards to some symbols not rendering well or not at all.

This is NOT a perfect copy of the book and it is not meant to be, it is just a printout from the author's website, which some people have trouble performing. If you want the original source, please purchase it from Amazon (link below). I will not be fixing PDF by hand to make this perfect.

PLEASE SUPPORT PROFESSOR IAN GOODFELLOW and the authors if you can purchase the paper book at Amazon. It is not expensive ($72) and probably contains content that is newer and without typographic mistakes.

Update: we just added a section [[Deep Learning Papers]](DeepLearningPapers.md) to this repository. We feel it complements very well the intention of this repository that is to help students to get all the relevant information about deep learning in one place.

For questions regarding the contents of the book, we encourage you to ask them on the book's forum
